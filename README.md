Notes on Stochastic Processes Course @ FMI

These are some notes that I created using LaTeX for Stochastic Processes Course I took in the Faculty of Mathematics and Infornmatics. It is based on Prof. Mladen Savov's notes. This document is meant for people that already have read those notes, or at least understand the material. This is a summary of the most important topics, covered in the course - Markov Chains, Poisson Processes, along with proofs(or proof ideas) of most theorems.
